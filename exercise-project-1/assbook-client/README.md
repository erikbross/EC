# Information about this class project

## Classes

Classes: HTTP, My-Geolocation and Map-Service were provided by the teacher. The rest of the classes were developed by me, the content of each function.  The name and attributes were provided by the teacher.

## Interfaces

All interfaces were provided by the professor

## Rest of code (TypeScript files)

All TypeScript files inside the resource folder (`src`) were developed by me. I followed a documentation provided by the teacher that explained us what to do for each element or anything else on each page. Some details were not reflected in the documentation, so I had to develop it by myself.

## Webpages (HTML and CSS files)

All HTML files and `style.css` were provided by the teacher and their content could not be modified. Only TypeScript files.
